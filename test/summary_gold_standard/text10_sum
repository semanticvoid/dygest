For some audiobuffs the johnny - come - lately transistor will never replace the purity of the valve , nor the compact disc the long - playing record . And in photography it is generally agreed that nothing recent has been as good a colour film as Kodachrome - - which turns 62 this year . Kodak had set up a temporary Kodachrome - processing centre in South Korea to allow him and his colleagues to turn their film round quickly . 

And in photography it is generally agreed that nothing recent has been as good a colour film as Kodachrome - - which turns 62 this year . Bringing out those perfect images requires 18 different photochemical processes . As a result , the machines used to develop Kodachrome are huge , expensive and rare . Kodak had set up a temporary Kodachrome - processing centre in South Korea to allow him and his colleagues to turn their film round quickly . 

And in photography it is generally agreed that nothing recent has been as good a colour film as Kodachrome - - which turns 62 this year . Not surprisingly , many prefer to use a lesser film that the local chemist can develop and return in an hour . And , since many old fogies also believe that a gifted amateur is worth a dozen slogging professionals , they will probably be pleased to learn that the job was done not by Kodak 's own engineers but by a dilettante chemist ( albeit one who is also a professional photographer ) . Kodak had set up a temporary Kodachrome - processing centre in South Korea to allow him and his colleagues to turn their film round quickly .
The heart of Mr Mackson 's innovation is a series of metre - long plastic tubes - within - tubes .
